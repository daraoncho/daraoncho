### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm **Dara**, a software engineer from Lagos, Nigeria.

I have great interest in **full-stack development**, **game development**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and everything in-between.

I'm a high distinction computer science graduate from Ekiti State University.

I'm fascinated by large-scale inventions and products that take things to the next level and impact people's lives!

Outside of work, I watch movies, play a lot of video games, and make tech-related videos
